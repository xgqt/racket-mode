  "A property list to describe a Racket Mode back end.

End users or other packages should NOT set this variable
directly. Instead they should supply a value for the
customization variable `racket-back-end-function'. See its
documentation for a description of the properties.

Initialized to nil so that failures to set this buffer-locally
will result in explicit error messages instead of silently using
the wrong back end.

Racket Mode major mode initialization functions should use
`racket--get-back-end' to get the value they should set
buffer-locally:

  (setq-local racket-back-end (`racket--get-back-end'))

Futhermore, commands that create buffers that do not visit a file
should use `(plist-get racket-back-end 'name)` as a suffix in the
buffer name -- permitting a unique buffer per back end as well as
making it easy for users to distinguish them. See the source for
`racket-describe-mode' as an example.

Note that values of the customization variable
`racket-repl-buffer-name-function' need to be \"host-aware\" --
e.g. even `racket-repl-buffer-name-shared' needs to return
different names for different hosts -- because a REPL on a back
end cannot run files hosted on another.")
